\title{Filter the co-accessibility from an ArchRProject}
\usage{
filterCoAccessibility(
  coAccessibilityLoops = NULL,
  corCutOff = NULL,
  perAccess = NULL,
  resolution = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{corCutOff}{A numeric describing the minimum numeric peak-to-peak correlation to return.}

\item{perAccess}{A numeric describing the minimum percent of accessible cells in both peaks in each pair.}

\item{resolution}{A numeric describing the bp resolution to use when returning loops. This helps with overplotting of correlated regions.}

\item{coAccessibility}{A coAccessibility DataFrame created by one of the coAccessibility functions.}
}
\description{
This function filters the co-accessibility by the specified parameters, like correlation cutoff or percent of accessible cells.
Additionally it can change the resolution of peaks to make the plots less convoluted.
}
\details{
When the resolution parameter is set, smaller loops are collapsed into one and the best correlation value is kept for this loop (same way as in the original ArchR).
