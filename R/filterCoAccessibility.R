#' Filter the co-accessibility from an ArchRProject
#' 
#' This function filters the co-accessibility by the specified parameters, like correlation cutoff or percent of accessible cells. 
#' Additionally it can change the resolution of peaks to make the plots less convoluted.
#' 
#' When the resolution parameter is set, smaller loops are collapsed into one and the best correlation value is kept for this loop (same way as in the original ArchR). 
#' 
#' @param coAccessibility A coAccessibility DataFrame created by one of the coAccessibility functions.
#' @param corCutOff A numeric describing the minimum numeric peak-to-peak correlation to return.
#' @param perAccess A numeric describing the minimum percent of accessible cells in both peaks in each pair.
#' @param resolution A numeric describing the bp resolution to use when returning loops. This helps with overplotting of correlated regions.
