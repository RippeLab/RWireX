Description: RWireX is based on our previously developed RWire package and implemented as an extension to the ArchR software package. It performs co-accessibility analysis of scATAC-seq data acquired by droplet-based single cell sequencing. RWireX employs a local background model, computes single-cell link activity scores, and provides co-accessibility maps of large genomic regions to identify interacting loci without pre-selecting specific viewpoints.
